# MusicBox
School project on a STM32 card. With my group we had to make music with a buzzer, we had to understand the documentation of the card to correctly use GPIO and interruptions... Everything is developed using C.

It will be diffucult for you to use this code because it's depend on how you have connected all the component on your card.
So I will only use this as a proof of my work.
